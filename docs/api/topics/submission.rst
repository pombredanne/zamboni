How to submit an app
====================

Submitting an app involves a few steps. The client must be logged in for all
these steps and the user submitting the app must have accepted the `terms of use`_.

1. :ref:`Validate your app <validation-post-label>`. The validation will return
   a valid manifest id or upload id.
2. :ref:`Post your app <app-post-label>` using the valid manifest id or upload
   id. This will create an app and populate the data with the
   contents of the manifest. It will return the current app data.
3. :ref:`Update your app <app-put-label>`. Not everything that the Firefox
   Marketplace needs will be in the app, as the manifest does not
   contain all the data. Update the required fields.
4. :ref:`Create a screenshot <screenshot-post-label>`. For listing on the
   Firefox Marketplace, at least one screenshot is needed.
5. :ref:`Ask for a review <enable-patch-label>`. All apps need to be reviewed,
   this will add it to the review queue.

Validate
========

.. note:: The validation does not require you to be authenticated, however you
    cannot create apps from those validations. To validate and submit an app
    you must be authenticated for both steps.

    **Request**

    :param manifest: URL to the manifest.
    :type manifest: string

    .. code-block:: json

        {"manifest": "http://test.app.com/manifest.webapp"}

    Or for a *packaged app*

    :param upload: a dictionary containing the appropriate file data in the upload field.
    :type upload: object

    **Response**

    :status 200: successfully completed.
    :status 400: something prevented the transition.


Key statuses are:

  * `incomplete`: incomplete
  * `pending`: pending
  * `public`: public
  * `waiting`: waiting to be public

Valid transitions that users can initiate are:

* *incomplete* to *pending*: call this once your app has been completed and it
  will be added to the Marketplace review queue. This can only be called if all
  the required data is there. If not, you'll get an error containing the
  reason. For example:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "error_message": {
                "status": [
                    "You must provide a support email.",
                    "You must provide at least one device type.",
                    "You must provide at least one category.",
                    "You must upload at least one screenshot or video."
                ]
            }
        }

* Once reviewed by the Marketplace review team, the app will be to *public* or
  *waiting to be public*.
* *waiting* to *public*: occurs when the app has been reviewed, but not yet
  been made public.
* *disabled_by_user*: by changing this value from `True` to `False` you can
  enable or disable an app.
