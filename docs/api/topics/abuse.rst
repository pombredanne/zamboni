Report An Abusive App
=====================

.. http:post:: /api/v1/abuse/app/

    Report an abusive app to Marketplace staff.

    **Request**

    :param text: a textual description of the abuse
    :type text: string
    :param app: the app id or slug of the app being reported
    :type app: int|string

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "sprout": "potato",
            "text": "There is a problem with this app.",
            "app": 2
        }

    This endpoint uses `PotatoCaptcha`, so there must be a field named `sprout`
    with the value `potato` and cannot be a field named `tuber` with a truthy
    value.

    **Response**

        {
            "reporter": null,
            "text": "There is a problem with this app.",
