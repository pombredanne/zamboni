Rocketfuel
==========

Rocketfuel is the consumer client for the Marketplace Publishing Tool. It has
some special APIs that are *not recommended* for consumption by other clients.

These APIs will change in conjunction with the Rocketfuel client, which is
under active development.

.. warning:: This API is for internal use only at this time. It SHOULD NOT be
    used externally by third parties. It is not considered stable and WILL
    change over time.


Collections
===========

A collection is a group of applications


.. note::

    When dealing with Collections in the API, translatable fields (currently
    name, description) are returned by default as an object containing all
    translations, with languages as keys:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "en-US": "Games",
            "fr": "Jeux",
            "kn": "ಆಟಗಳು"
        }

    If you pass the `lang` parameter to a `GET` request, then then only the most
    relevant translation (the specified language or the fallback, depending on
    whether a translation is available) will be returned as a string.


Listing
-------

.. http:get:: /api/v1/rocketfuel/collections/

    A listing of all collections.

    .. note:: Authentication is optional.

    **Request**:

    The following query string parameters can be used to filter the results:

    :param cat: a category ID/slug.
    :type cat: int|string
    :param region: a region ID/slug.
    :type region: int|string
    :param carrier: a carrier ID/slug.
    :type carrier: int|string

    Filtering on null values is done by omiting the value for the corresponding
    parameter in the query string.

.. _rocketfuel-fallback:

    If no results are found with the filters specified, the API will
    automatically use a fallback mechanism and try to change the values to null
    in order to try to find some results.

    The order in which the filters are set to null is:
        1. `region`
        2. `carrier`
        3. `region` and `carrier`.

    In addition, if that fallback mechanism is used, HTTP responses will have an
    additional `API-Fallback` header, containing the fields which were set to
    null to find the returned results, separated by a comma if needed, like this:

    `API-Fallback: region, carrier`

Create
