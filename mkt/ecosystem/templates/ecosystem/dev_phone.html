              Firefox OS is a new mobile operating system built entirely using open web standards. In Firefox OS,
              HTML5 apps can directly control phone hardware and key functionality — for example making the phone
              vibrate, placing phone calls, and sending text messages.

              We believe that developers will be truly instrumental in bringing the power of the web to mobile, so
              we have worked with various partners to make devices available for developing and testing apps, and
              learning more about customizing Firefox OS itself. This page provides useful information to developers,
              such as links to developer documentation, available devices, and where to obtain them.

              Mozilla, Geeksphone, and Telefónica worked together to create the Geeksphone Keon and Peak, respectively
              low-end and higher-end preview phones for developers wanting to start developing on real Firefox OS
              devices. Note that no more phones are being produced at this moment in time, although another run is
              planned for the future. A number will remain in circulation however, and these devices are still very
              valid for developer testing, having full updates available to them.

              <strong>If you have just received a Geeksphone Keon or Peak, it is probably still running the out-of-date Firefox OS version 1.0.1.

              When developing for a nascent platform, useful sources of information are always more difficult to find
              than for more established platforms. To give Firefox OS developers as much help as possible, we'd like
