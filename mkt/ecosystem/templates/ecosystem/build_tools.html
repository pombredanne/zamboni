          What do you use to build Open Web Apps? The answer is
          &quot;anything you would normally use to build for the web.&quot;
          The following is a list of tools and resources to help you get
          started making Open Web Apps. They can be easily integrated into
          your existing web development workflow, if you have one, or you can
          build a new workflow around them.

          To help you start writing web apps quickly, we provide a few
          templates which has a lot already set up. Each template is a static
          web project with tools to help build and deploy.

          You have a Firefox OS app but you don't have a Firefox OS phone to
          test it on? The Firefox OS simulator will let you run your app in
          the browser, so you can test early and often.
