      <h2>{{ _('What is the purpose of your app?') }}</h2>

          If you already have a list of tasks, an idea for your app and the
          type of user you are targeting, it's time to create a goal
          statement: Define your app's purpose and the most important user
          in one sentence. This is your main use case.
        {% endtrans -%}
      </p>
      <p>
        {%- trans %}
          Example: A wish list creation tool for people who never do impulse
          shopping.
        {% endtrans -%}
      </p>

      <h2>{{ _('Focus on one main use case') }}</h2>
      <p>
        {%- trans %}
          It is possible that you cannot include all the tasks on your list
          in your goal statement. That is ok, because you should focus on
          one main use cases, which is how most people will use your
          application. Awesome apps do one thing well.
        {% endtrans -%}
      </p>

      <h2>{{ _('How will people use your app?') }}</h2>
      <p>
        {%- trans %}
          By now, you've identified your main use case, target users, and key
          features. Your main scenario should also consider the user
          environment in which your app is used. For example, a young mom
          with her baby at daycare might use your app to note a nice
          stroller (potential multi-tasking, pausing and continuing the task
          later). A different user might plan her next laptop purchase at
          home, in an armchair, without interruptions.
        {% endtrans -%}
      </p>

      <h2>{{ _('Concentrate on a few key features') }}</h2>
      <p>
        {%- trans %}
          Look at your task list again. Filter your list through the goal
          statement. If the tasks do not align with your goal statement,
          exclude them in your app.
        {% endtrans -%}
      </p>
      <p>
        {%- trans %}
          Describe each core task as a feature and then ask yourself, is
          this feature essential? Or is it nice-to-have but not required by
          the target user to complete the defined task? Be honest with
          yourself. If you end up with a short list of features, you are on
          the right track.
        {% endtrans -%}
      </p>
      <p>
        {%- trans %}
          Remember, the best apps usually do one thing well. Apps often fail
          not because they have too little features, but too many.
        {% endtrans -%}
      </p>

      <h2>{{ _('Your app in its most basic form') }}</h2>
      <p>
        {%- trans %}
          Once you have a few key moments, you can translate those steps into
          screens. You can sketch out the user flow, that is, what do your
          users go from one screen to another to complete a task.
        {% endtrans -%}
      </p>
      <p>
        {%- trans %}
          Think about the information a user wants to see and record.
          Consider which user interface (UI) elements correspond to the
          information above. Put things that your users need most often in
          the most prominent places in the screens. Even just writing out
          the sequence of moments helps define a wireframe model of your app
          and its features.
