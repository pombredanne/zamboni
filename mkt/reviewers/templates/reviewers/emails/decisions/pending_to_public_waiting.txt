Congratulations! Your app has been approved for the Firefox Marketplace. Because you requested to make the app available to the public when you want, you will need to log in to the Firefox Marketplace and make it public manually. To enable it, visit its Manage Status page ({{ status_url }}). (If you did not request a publishing delay, please read the reviewer comments below for more details.)
