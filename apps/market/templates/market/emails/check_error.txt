Oh fearless admins something has gone wrong with a cron job. When checking
PayPal add-ons to see which cannot be sold through PayPal we got too many
failures. This could have been genuine but it could also have been an
intermittent error, so we've not altered any add-ons. Time to check the
logs to see what happened:

Add-ons or apps checked: {{ checked }}
Number of failures: {{ failed|numberfmt }}
Number of passes: {{ passed|numberfmt }}

Failure rate: {{ rate }}%
Limit of failures before triggering this: {{ limit }}%

Failures:

{% for url in failure_list %}
    {{ url }}
{% endfor %}
