Dear Developer,

Your add-on {{ addon.name }} has been disabled on the Firefox Marketplace. We checked the PayPal account of {{ addon.paypal_id }} and found the following errors:

{% for error in errors %}
    {{ error }}
{% endfor %}

If you correct these errors on PayPal, you can submit your add-on to the Marketplace again:

    {{ url }}

Thank you.
