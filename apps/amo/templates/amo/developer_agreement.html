      Mozilla encourages you to make your AMO Contribution available under an

     <strong>Management of AMO Services.</strong>

     Mozilla may manage the AMO Services in a manner designed to facilitate the
     integrity and proper functioning of the AMO Services without limitation or
     liability. The following is a list of exemplary activities that Mozilla in
     its sole discretion may undertake as part of its management of the AMO
     Services: (i) monitor, test and review AMO Contributions; (ii) remove or

     through the AMO API (as described below).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>AMO <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>.</strong>
      As part of the AMO Services, Mozilla provides the addons.mozilla.org API
      (&#8220;<strong>AMO API</strong>&#8221;), which allows you to get
      information about certain AMO Contributions distributed by Mozilla via the
      AMO Service and is currently served via calls to
      https://services.addons.mozilla.org/api/.
      You may use the AMO API solely to retrieve data made publicly available by
      Mozilla via the AMO API, which data may be used solely for your own
      reasonable business purposes or personal use. In addition to the
      restrictions otherwise set forth in the Terms regarding AMO Services
      generally, you agree that you are responsible for your use of and
      contribution to the AMO API and you will not:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        hide or mask from Mozilla the identity of your service as it uses the
        AMO API, including by failing to follow required identification
        conventions; or
      </li>
      <li>
        use the AMO API for any application that replicates or attempts to
        replicate the Mozilla AMO Service or experience
        unless your use of the AMO API is non-confusing. By non-confusing,
        Mozilla means that people should always know with whom they are dealing
        and where the information or software they are downloading came from.
        Websites and software that are not produced by Mozilla shouldn’t imply,
        either directly or by omission, that they are.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Firefox Sync Add-ons.</strong>
      If your AMO Contribution utilizes any Firefox Sync APIs
      or software, you agree (a) that you and your AMO Contribution will use
      the Firefox Sync APIs solely for their intended purpose; (b) that your
      AMO Contribution will not hide or mask its identity as it uses Mozilla’s
      hosted Firefox Sync services and/or Firefox Sync APIs, including by
      failing to follow required identification conventions; and (c) that
      you and your AMO Contribution will not use the Firefox Sync APIs for
      any application or service that replicates or attempts to replicate
      Mozilla’s hosted Firefox Sync services or experience unless such use
      is non-confusing. Your AMO Contribution shall not imply, either directly
      or by omission, that it is produced or endorsed by Mozilla.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Ownership, Reservation of Mozilla's Rights.</strong>

      You are welcome to use the AMO Services subject to these Terms, and
      Mozilla grants you the right to do so. Mozilla and its licensors reserve
      all other rights in the AMO Services. Further, nothing in the Terms shall
      be deemed to grant you any right to use the trademarks, trade names,
      service marks, or trade dress of Mozilla or its licensors and Mozilla
      hereby reserves all right, title and interest therein. For information on
      our trademarks, please see our

        &#8220;as-is&#8221;. Mozilla, its contributors, licensors, and distributors,
        disclaim all warranties,</strong>
        whether express or implied, including without limitation, implied
        warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
        non-infringement. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
        limitation of implied warranties, so this disclaimer may not apply to
        you.

  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Limitation of Liability. Except as required by law, Mozilla,
        its contributors, licensors, and distributors will not be liable for any</strong>
        indirect, special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary <strong>damages
        arising out of or in any way relating to the use of AMO Services</strong>
        and their <strong>collective liability</strong>
        under these Terms <strong>will not exceed US$500</strong> (five hundred US dollars). Some
        jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages,
        so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to you.
      </strong>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Indemnification for AMO Contributions.</strong>
      If anyone brings a claim against Mozilla related to your actions or the AMO
      Contributions, you will indemnify and hold Mozilla harmless from and against
      all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable legal fees
      and costs) related to such claim.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Changes to the Terms.</strong>
      Mozilla may update these Terms as necessary from time to time. The updated Terms
      will only apply to AMO Contributions submitted after the update and you will be
      presented with the revised Terms the next time you submit an AMO Contribution.
      These Terms may not be modified or cancelled without Mozilla’s written agreement.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Eligibility.</strong>

      You represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and
      that you are not a person barred from receiving or using the AMO Services
      under the laws of any country, including the country in which you are
      resident or from which you use the AMO Services.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Export Control.</strong>
      Export and import laws, restrictions, and regulations of the United States
      and other foreign agencies may apply.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Miscellaneous.</strong>
      These Terms are governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A.,
      excluding its conflict of law provisions. If any portion of these Terms is
      held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions will remain in
      full force and effect. In the event of a conflict between a translated
      version of these Terms and the English language version, the English
      language version shall control. Mozilla’s subsidiaries and affiliates
      shall be third party beneficiaries of these Terms, entitled to enforce and
      rely upon the provisions hereof.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Termination.</strong>

      You may terminate your use of the AMO Services at any time. Mozilla may
