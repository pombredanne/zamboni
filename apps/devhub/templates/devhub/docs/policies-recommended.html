  <h3>{{ _('Criteria for Featured Add-ons') }}</h3>

  <p>
  {% trans %}
  Before nominating an add-on to be featured, please ensure it meets the following criteria:
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <ol>
      <li>{{ _('The add-on must have a complete and informative listing on AMO. This means:') }}</li>
      <ul>
          <li>{{ _('a 64-pixel custom icon') }}</li>
          <li>{{ _('a clear and concise name (no lengthy keywords)') }}</li>
          <li>{{ _('a clear and concise summary of the add-on\'s functionality') }}</li>
          <li>{{ _('detailed description and privacy policy, if applicable') }}</li>
          <li>{{ _('updated screenshots of the add-on\'s functionality') }}</li>
          <li>{{ _('must be fully approved by AMO editors (no preliminarily reviewed entries)') }}</li>
      </ul>
      <li>{% trans %}The add-on must have excellent user reviews and any problems or support requests must be promptly addressed by the developer.{% endtrans %}</li>
      <li>{% trans %}The add-on must be compatible with the latest release of Firefox and must be compatible with beta versions 4 weeks before their final release.{% endtrans %}</li>
      <li>{% trans %}<strong>Most importantly</strong>, the add-on must have wide consumer appeal to Firefox's users and be outstanding in nearly every way: user experience, performance, security, and usefulness or entertainment value. Featured complete themes must also be visually appealing.{% endtrans %}</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>{{ _('Nominating an Add-on') }}</h3>

  <p>
  {% trans mail_featured=emaillink('amo-featured@mozilla.org', _('amo-featured at mozilla dot org')) %}
  If you wish to nominate an add-on to be featured and it meets the criteria above, send an email to {{ mail_featured }} with:
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>{{ _('the add-on name, URL, and whether you are its developer') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('an explanation of why the add-on has wide appeal and should be featured') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('optionally, links to any external reviews or articles mentioning the add-on') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('optionally, a video overview/demo/tutorial of the add-on not more than 5 minutes long') }}</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  {% trans %}
  Extension nominations are reviewed by the Advisory Board once a month (once every 3 months for complete theme nominations), and you will receive an email regarding the decision and any suggestions for improvement. Common reasons for rejection include lacking wide appeal to consumers, a suboptimal user experience, quality or security issues, incompatibility, and similarity to another featured add-on. Rejected add-ons cannot be re-nominated within 3 months.
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <h3>{{ _('Rotating Featured Add-ons') }}</h3>

  <p>
  {% trans %}
  Mozilla and the Featured Add-ons Advisory Board regularly evaluate and rotate out featured add-ons. Some of the most common reasons for add-ons being removed from the featured list are:
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
    {% trans %}
    Lack of growth &mdash; Add-ons that are featured typically experience a substantial gain in both downloads and active users. If an add-on is not demonstrating growth in any substantial way, that's a good indicator the add-on may not be very useful to our users.
    {% endtrans %}
    </li>
    <li>
    {% trans %}
    Negative reviews &mdash; Featured add-ons should have a great experience and very few bugs, so add-ons with many negative reviews may be reconsidered.
    {% endtrans %}
    </li>
    <li>
    {% trans %}
    Incompatibility with upcoming Firefox versions &mdash; Featured add-ons are expected to be compatible with stable and beta versions of Firefox. Add-ons not yet compatible with a Beta version of Firefox four weeks before its expected release will lose their featured status.
    {% endtrans %}
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>{{ _('Joining the Featured Add-ons Advisory Board') }}</h3>

  <p>
  {% trans %}
  Every six months a new Advisory Board is chosen based on applications from the add-ons community. Members must:
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <ul>
      <li>{{ _('be active members of the add-ons community, whether as a developer, evangelist, or fan') }}</li>
      <li>{{ _('commit to trying all the nominations submitted, giving their feedback, and casting their votes every month') }}</li>
      <li>{{ _("join a monthly conference call to go through the votes and select the next month's featured add-ons (featured complete themes will be discussed on every third call)") }}</li>
      <li>{{ _('abstain from voting on add-ons that they have any business or personal affiliations with, as well as direct competitors of any such add-ons') }}</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  {% trans %}
  Members of the Mozilla Add-ons team may veto any add-on's selection because of security, privacy, compatibility, or any other reason, but in general it is up to the Board to select add-ons to feature.
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <p>
  {% trans %}
  This featured policy only applies to the addons.mozilla.org global list of featured add-ons. Add-ons featured in other locations are often pulled from this list, but Mozilla may feature any add-on in other locations without the Board's consent. Additionally, locale-specific features override the global defaults, so if a locale has opted to select its own features, some or all of the global features may not appear in that locale.
